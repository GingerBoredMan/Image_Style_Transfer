# Image Style Transfer

  An implimentation of image style transfer as described in **Gatys, L.A., Ecker, A.S. and Bethge, M., 2016. Image style transfer using convolutional neural networks. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 2414-2423)** on Pytorch.

  The implimentation uses conv layers of VGG19 to obtain content and style representations.
